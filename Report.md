# Exploring Ethics and Safety-infused Computation Architectures

We want to build a computing architecture inspired by decades of cognitive science research that has the following three components:

**(1) Hardware** - Computation structures that read raw data and classify the data into pre-determined categories.

**(2) Computation Unit** - Contains the computation logic, e.g., rules, knowledge representation, and their mappings from the categories to concepts.

**(3) Control Unit** - Controls how the computation unit and the hardware interact using shared buffers.

Within the computation units, we want to capture the end-user's ethical values and a global notion of "safety". To realize such an architecture, we aim to explore several computing fields we have recently come across and studied, e.g., Knowledge-aware-liquid Time Constant Networks (K-LTCNs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to constrain parameter learning in the computation unit. For the hardware, we plan to use pre-trained neural network models. We plan to develop a neurosymbolic method for the control unit that governs learning the K-LTCNs and CBFs. Objectives of this architecture are robust reasoning, efficiency, and demonstrable retention of the end-user's notions of ethics and global safety standards.
